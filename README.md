# Matlab-COVID19analysis

Recently Mathworks launched a Matlab Challenge in the field of Data Science.

In the analysis data from 
"COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University"
are used.

In case you do not have access to Matlab with Live Script Editor, you can read the major files in PDF.
